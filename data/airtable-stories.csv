## Update from call with Sarah (11th February)

We need to:

* Change the second sentence in the cookie banner to something along the lines of “We would like to use cookies to help us improve our services.”
* Add a section and a separate on/off switch for optional, first-party cookies to the cookie policy page.
* Edit the Google Analytics section in the cookie policy to make it obvious that they’re third party cookies.
* Update the “Time” column header in the table.
* Update “Used to throttle request rate"" text to be more easily understandable.

Search pages should at `/search/MY%20COOL%20PRODUCT`, `/search/MY%20COOL%20PRODUCT?page=2`, etc..

Old URLs should be redirected to these URLs.","Customers can bookmark pages like `/substance/ibuprofen` and then access the same information when navigating to these directly as when navigating them within site links.
