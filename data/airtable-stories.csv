DESIGN - Search results Copy tweaks - V2,As a Product Lead we need to ensure the final copy is applied to the site....so that we can get sign off from the business,,"1. The disclaimer design now matches the design document
2. The search results copy reads as:

If the product information you are seeking does not appear below, it is possible that the product holds a European licence and its information may be available at the European Medicines Agency website.

Before a medicine can be sold in the UK, a number of licenses are essential. Products with a UK marketing authorisation have a licence number in the format ‘PL 12345/0001’. 

The first 2 characters are always the letters ‘PL’, and this can be found on the packaging of the product.You can identify the product in the list below using the PL number.

The information about a medicine will be updated when new evidence becomes available.  This may mean that there are differences between the information in the pack and the information here.  The most up-to-date information will be available on this site. (This paragraph change came from VRMM....compared to Kyle's word document)

3. The disclaimer text reads as:

I understand that this information is a copy of the Summary of Product Characteristics and patient information leaflet for a medicine, which outline the conditions under which the medicine should be used and information on its known safety.

I understand that this information may be updated several times during the product’s lifecycle, and that there could be differences between the of the information shown here and other information in the public domain.

I understand that the MHRA is unable to offer medical advice and that if a patient has any questions about a medicine they are taking they should contact their doctor or pharmacist. Patients should not stop taking any prescribed medicines without first speaking to a healthcare professional. Suspected adverse reactions to a medicine can be reported to us on a Yellow Card.

I understand that the MHRA has used its best endeavours in publishing this information, but accept that the information may not be the most up to date version for this product.",,"Attached to this ticket:
1. Agreement from Kyle on the slight differences in wording from the disclaimer that is currently on the site, compared to what has been applied to the new site.
2. A screen shot of what the search results wording used to say, using the wording from Kyle's document.
3. Request from VRMM to change the search results wording (paragraph relating to shelf life), compared to Kyle's original wording",,,,,Done,Skateboard Lite 🛹,,Rafa Prada,,,"Designs:

Before a medicine can be sold in the UK, a number of licenses are essential. Products with a UK marketing authorisation have a licence number in the format ‘PL 12345/0001’. The first 2 characters are always the letters ‘PL’, and this can be found on the packaging of the product.

You can identify the product in the list below using the PL number.

The information about a medicine will be updated when new evidence become available.  This may mean that there are differences between the information in the pack and the information here. The most up-to-date information will be available on this site.  ","1.
